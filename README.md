# mood_tracker
Overview: 

The Mood Tracker Journal is a simple program designed to help users track their daily moods and emotions. 
This project aims to provide a platform where users can log their emotions, thoughts, and experiences, facilitating self-awareness, emotional regulation, and personal growth. 
By maintaining a regular journal of their moods, users can identify patterns, triggers, and make positive changes in their lives.

Uses text2emotion to quantify emotions to give users insight into their moods and emotions. 
Journals are saved to text documents to ensure privacy and security. Add textfile to a cloud platform like dropbox to allow access on your phone, laptop, etc. 

Currently in the works to add a calendar view, data analysis, and further improving emotion quantification
